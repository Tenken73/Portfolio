# JeQa Powe: Operations & Economic Analyst | Active TS/SCI

## The Core Mission (The Hook)

The same tools that map threats can map opportunity. I’m a cleared Operations Analyst and Howard Economist who spent **ten years building and maintaining critical IT systems.** I leverage geospatial analysis and LLMs—the same methods I used at **JWAC**—to combat Black wealth disparity. Food deserts aren't accidents; they are policy outcomes. My mission is to measure and dismantle those structures.
